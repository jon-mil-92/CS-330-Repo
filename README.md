> *How do I approach designing software?*
* *What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?*
    After working on this project, I have learned some new design skills. First, I have gained a better understanding of how to implement large projects incrementally. I have also learned how to fully utilize external libraries in C++. Including external libraries allowed me to expedite implementation by utilizing functions built into the library. This allowed me to build on the work of others by using open-source software. I also gained a better understanding for creating modular and reusable code.
* *What design process did you follow for your project work?*
    I utilized an incremental design process. Each iteration of design built upon the last. For example, the architecture of the project was designed piece-by-piece. First, the architecture was designed to support a single complex shape. Then the architecture was designed to apply textures to that shape. And lastly, the architecture was designed to add lighting to the shape. After the architecture was fully designed to support the rendering of a single complex object composed of multiple primitive shapes, it was expanded upon to render multiple complex shapes.
* *How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?*
    My design approach can be utilized in projects involving topics other than 3D rendering. This design approach is similar to an Agile development process, and it can be utilized in projects that are to be expanded through the implementation of additional features.
  
> *How do I approach developing programs?*
* *What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?*
    I utilized the development strategy of iteration. The project started off with the implementation of a basic feature, and then new features were added in each development cycle. This Agile development process allowed me to rapidly expand upon each iteration.
* *How did iteration factor into your development?*
    Throughout each iteration of development, new features were added. Each iteration led to a more comprehensive project that became closer to my overall goal of recreating the picture I took at the beginning of the class with 3D graphics using OpenGL.
* *How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?*
    My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones. I gained a better understanding of the OpenGL API during each iteration of development. This allowed me to further optimize and modularize my code base to increase performance, readability, and reusability.
  
> *How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?*
* *How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?*
    Studying computational graphics has given me the knowlege to fully render an interactive scene in 3D with the OpenGL API. During this process, I gained a better understanding of how to utilize linear algebra and geometric calculations in my code. This knowlege has enabled me to create interactive 3D media using C++ and the OpenGL API. These skill will prove useful for programming the rendering of complex 3D models with textures and the Phong lighting model in other projects.
